          </h2>

            <h3 class="mr-2 p-3 rounded-lg w-64 bg-[#CCCDCC]">
              Before this particular scene, Caesar was warned by the soothsayer
              about the ides of March. However, as triumphantly expressed above,
              Caesar believes that the ides of March are over. Which results in
              the soothsayer providing Caesar with an even more ambiguous
              response, that fate might still prevail.
            </h3>
            <h3 class="mr-2 p-3 rounded-lg w-64 bg-[#CCCDCC]">
              In addition, Caesar is given another warning. Artemidorus urges
              Caesar to read his letter which contains the events that are bound
              to happen later. However, Caesar denies to read any letters
              pertaining to him as he believes he must prioritize other's
              welfare rather than his own.
            </h3>
            <h3 class="mr-2 p-3 rounded-lg w-64 bg-[#CCCDCC]">
              Both of the denials by Caesar create a dramatic irony between the
              audience. As the audience is aware of the future assassination and
              the importance of the warnings. But, Caesar continues to ignore
              them which will eventually lead him to his own downfall.

            <h2 class="text-center">
              This line stands out in many ways. Firstly, it is one of the only
              uses of latin in the play. Additionally, there is a very strong
              meaning behind it. “Et tu Brute” or “You too Brutus”. The phrase
              represents the moment when Caesar realizes that even his trusted
              friend, Brutus, has joined the conspirators in assassinating him.
              The line is a poignant representation of betrayal, friendship, and
              power, and it has become a popular phrase in modern culture to
              express a sense of betrayal or disappointment.

          >
            Antony plays the key role in the rest of the tragedy. During the
            assassination, the conspirators made sure Antony was not there, so
            their plan would go accordingly. After the death of Caesar, Antony
            went to the capital to make peace with conspirators. He first asks
            if he is able to speak at the funeral. Brutus agrees as he thinks
            everyone will agree with his logic, however Cassius is doubtful as
            he is aware of Antony’s strong rhetorical appeal. Additionally,
            Antony has a soliloquy where he expresses his true intentions. As
            shown in the excerpt above, Caesar’s ghost will avenge his death.
            The allusion in the excerpt supports this idea as Ate is the ancient
            Greek goddess of destruction and folly, who is by Caesar’s “side”.
            The excerpt also foreshadows the upcoming war which most definitely
            includes destruction and folly.
